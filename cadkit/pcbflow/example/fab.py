"""The order packages for this project's boards: gerbers, drill, BOM, CPL, one zip each.

COPY THIS FILE TO YOUR PROJECT AS `elec/fab.py`, then:

    "C:/Program Files/KiCad/10.0/bin/python.exe" elec/fab.py           # every board in BOARDS
    "C:/Program Files/KiCad/10.0/bin/python.exe" elec/fab.py blinky    # just one

(KiCad's own Python: the drill check reads the board with pcbnew.)

It refuses to package a board that is not finished (unconnected items, DRC violations, a
failed length-match), checks the gerbers and drill against the board, and writes
ROTATION-CHECK.txt and ORDER.txt into each zip. See cadkit/pcbflow/fab_package.py.
