# v2 punch list — from the 2026-10-04 CAD review

Nine items, raised against screenshots of `assembly_v2.step`. Each one is
closed only when a gate or a measurement says so, not when the code changes.
Status is maintained here; the reasoning lives next to the code.

| # | item | state |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Lid needs a screw access path — the 45 ramp blocks the driver | **done** |
| 2 | Lid needs a skirt; 20 mm clear on all sides before the battery mount, -Z needs a wiring hole | **done** |
| 3 | Lid's 4 M4s and their inside bosses come out; wood screws hold it | **done** |
| 4 | The extra chunk at the wiring window is unnecessary — plain wall, then cut | **done** |
| 5 | Battery-mount wings are v1 joinery, dead in v2 (one side: Y 3.00..17.30) | **done** |
| 6 | The green water line makes a strange vertical jump | **done** (and it is a blocker — see DESIGN_V2 open question 0) |
| 7 | PCB retained by plastic on all sides but -X; drop to one M4 via cadkit's hole cutter; 45 ramp -X retention on +Y edge, slot-and-rotate install | **done** |
| 8 | Wiring window is not placed to reach the four blocks on the board's bottom edge | **done** |
| 9 | Port bronner's PCB debuggability work (test pads, silkscreen); re-audit the board end to end | **done** (twelve findings, a new gate, five cadkit bugs) |

## Notes on scope

* 1, 2 and 3 are one change: the lid stops being a flanged plate with its own
  M4s and becomes a shoebox lid retained by the two +X wood screws. The earlier
  "WHY THERE IS NO PERIMETER SKIRT" finding in `src/housing.py` measured the
  skirt as impossible **inward** (a -0.06 mm gap in Y) and as having nothing to
  lap **outward** over the bay footprint. The user's measurement says otherwise
  for the outward case: 20 mm of drop is clear on all sides before the battery
  mount. That finding has to be re-measured, not assumed.
* 7 changes the overlap and overhang baselines, so both gates get re-run and
  any whitelist entry that moves gets re-measured and re-named.
* 9 is a PCB audit, not a CAD change; it ends in `elec/` and the fab gate.
  It landed as **ten net-labelled bring-up pads**, **twelve findings** in
  `elec/CIRCUIT.md` (four would have stopped the board, one would have destroyed
  it), and `tools/check_ic_pinouts.py` — the gate the audit's own conclusion
  asked for, since *nothing in the pipeline checked a pin map or a voltage*.
  Adding the pads also flushed out **five bugs in cadkit**, each of which
  produced a board that read as clean: a search graded by a rule it did not use,
  a failed search that left a pad shorting VBAT to a GPIO, a use-after-free in
  `board.Remove()`, two vias in one hole, and a fab report in which an explicit
  "undecided" declaration lost to a footprint guess.


## Round 2

| # | item | status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Check the retractable-cable-spool project for its wood-screw head size; make sure the lid hole passes it | **done** — Ø9.3, and our countersink was Ø9.0 |
| 2 | Remove the diamond tie slots | **done** |
| 3 | Battery wiring on the plate's +X side needs a way in: a hole -Z of the PCB box, then a 90° turn +Z | **done** |
| 4 | Oversize the ±Z board stops by 2.4 mm; put 1.6 mm of square prism on the +Y ramp's tip | **done** |
| 5 | Why is a part hanging off the edge of the board? | **answered** — deliberate, see below |

### What the measurements said

**1. The screw is bigger than the hole was.** `retractable-cable-spool/src/params.py`
carries it as "v2's validated screw geometry, verbatim": shaft Ø4.0, **head Ø9.3**,
cone 4.0 deep. Two things followed. The housing's countersink was **Ø9.0 — three
tenths SMALLER than the head**, so the head would have landed on the pocket's rim
instead of seating in it; it opens Ø9.6 now. And the lid's access bore was Ø9.5,
which clears a Ø9.3 head by a tenth of a millimetre per side — a fit, not a hole
you post a screw down on the end of a long bit. It is Ø11.0 now, which in turn
forced the lid's countersink seat from 3.0 to 3.5 mm, because a 45° cone from
Ø11 to Ø4.5 is 3.25 deep.

The 45° pocket is the right shape and not a printing accident: its half-angle is
steeper than an 82° wood screw's, so the head contacts near the mouth and pulls
flush. A shallower pocket would bottom the head out and hold the plate off the post.

**3. The wire entry had a 7 mm window and all three edges were measured.**
Z ≤ 11.0 is the bay's -Z wall; Z ≥ 4.0 is the floor plank's top, measured off the
frame solid, below which the slot opens into timber; Y 121.7..172.0 is the chase at
one end and the +Y post's inboard face at the other. The slot is 22 × 5 mm at
Y 139..161, Z 5.5..10.5, and the 90° turn needs no pocket cut for it — the chase
already removes the bay's -Z wall across that whole Y band, so once the leads are
through the plate they look straight up into the bay. Verified by sweeping a Ø4
probe along both legs against the housing *and* the lumber: clear.

**5. Nothing is wrong — U2's antenna has to leave the laminate.** The ESP32
footprint's courtyard is not the module outline; it is a T-shaped polygon that
includes the antenna fan, and the matching keepout bans tracks, vias, pads, pour
**and footprints** inside it. So the fan has to hang off a board edge rather than
lie across the board, and rot 270 puts it over the +X edge where the only thing
left under it is a mounting-hole cutout, which a keepout does not forbid. The
module body overhangs by **4.12 mm**; every one of its castellated pads is still
over laminate. The housing already accounts for it — `BOARD_Y_PLUS` is taken from
the posed board's bounding box, not the laminate, which is why the bay cavity is
wider on that side than the board is.

### Notes

* The tie slots in #2 were the screw terminals' only strain relief. The battery
  pair does not miss them: #3's slot is a close fit through a 3 mm plate with a
  90° bend against it, which is relief for the one pair carrying 7.5 A. The leads
  arriving *down* the chase from the tank side still have none, and `src/housing.py`
  now says so in as many words rather than leaving the absence to look deliberate.
* #4's stops reach 2.4 mm past the laminate's top face, leaving 17.1 mm of air to
  the lid. The retention gate's reading went from 21 mm³ of lip in the way to 88.
* The overhang gate caught a bug in #3 before the build did: the slot was extruded
  the wrong way down +X and cut a 0.5 mm blind pocket in the back of the plate
  instead of a through hole, which it reported as 104.6 mm² of flat ceiling.
