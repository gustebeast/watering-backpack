# v2 punch list — from the 2026-10-04 CAD review

Nine items, raised against screenshots of `assembly_v2.step`. Each one is
closed only when a gate or a measurement says so, not when the code changes.
Status is maintained here; the reasoning lives next to the code.

| # | item | state |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Lid needs a screw access path — the 45 ramp blocks the driver | **done** |
| 2 | Lid needs a skirt; 20 mm clear on all sides before the battery mount, -Z needs a wiring hole | **done** |
| 3 | Lid's 4 M4s and their inside bosses come out; wood screws hold it | **done** |
| 4 | The extra chunk at the wiring window is unnecessary — plain wall, then cut | **done** |
| 5 | Battery-mount wings are v1 joinery, dead in v2 (one side: Y 3.00..17.30) | **done** |
| 6 | The green water line makes a strange vertical jump | **done** (and it is a blocker — see DESIGN_V2 open question 0) |
| 7 | PCB retained by plastic on all sides but -X; drop to one M4 via cadkit's hole cutter; 45 ramp -X retention on +Y edge, slot-and-rotate install | **done** |
| 8 | Wiring window is not placed to reach the four blocks on the board's bottom edge | **done** |
| 9 | Port bronner's PCB debuggability work (test pads, silkscreen); re-audit the board end to end | **done** (twelve findings, a new gate, five cadkit bugs) |

## Notes on scope

* 1, 2 and 3 are one change: the lid stops being a flanged plate with its own
  M4s and becomes a shoebox lid retained by the two +X wood screws. The earlier
  "WHY THERE IS NO PERIMETER SKIRT" finding in `src/housing.py` measured the
  skirt as impossible **inward** (a -0.06 mm gap in Y) and as having nothing to
  lap **outward** over the bay footprint. The user's measurement says otherwise
  for the outward case: 20 mm of drop is clear on all sides before the battery
  mount. That finding has to be re-measured, not assumed.
* 7 changes the overlap and overhang baselines, so both gates get re-run and
  any whitelist entry that moves gets re-measured and re-named.
* 9 is a PCB audit, not a CAD change; it ends in `elec/` and the fab gate.
  It landed as **ten net-labelled bring-up pads**, **twelve findings** in
  `elec/CIRCUIT.md` (four would have stopped the board, one would have destroyed
  it), and `tools/check_ic_pinouts.py` — the gate the audit's own conclusion
  asked for, since *nothing in the pipeline checked a pin map or a voltage*.
  Adding the pads also flushed out **five bugs in cadkit**, each of which
  produced a board that read as clean: a search graded by a rule it did not use,
  a failed search that left a pad shorting VBAT to a GPIO, a use-after-free in
  `board.Remove()`, two vias in one hole, and a fab report in which an explicit
  "undecided" declaration lost to a footprint guess.
